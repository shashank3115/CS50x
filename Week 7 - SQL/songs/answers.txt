1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, their audio aura could be described as energetic and joyful, since the songs have high danceability, energy, and generally positive valence. This suggests the listener enjoys upbeat and lively music.

2. This calculation might not be very representative of the listener because it only considers their top 100 most played songs, ignoring the rest of their music library and the context in which they listen. It also reduces their preferences to just three features (energy, danceability, valence), which oversimplifies musical taste. A better approach would be to include the entire listening history, consider more features such as acousticness, speechiness, and loudness, and weight songs by listening context and frequency. Machine learning clustering could also provide a more accurate and personalized representation of the listenerâ€™s audio aura.
